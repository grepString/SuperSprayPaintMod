## Installation Guide

Note: If you're installing an updated version of this mod, just overwrite the existing files.

### 1. Install UE4SS
- Download the **experimental-latest** zDEV version of UE4SS from [GitHub](https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS/releases/tag/experimental-latest)
- Place the `ue4ss` folder and `dwmapi.dll` in:  
  `Drive Beyond Horizons\DriveBeyondHorizons\Binaries\Win64`

### 2. Install the Mod
- Download the mod from [GitHub](https://github.com/grepString/SuperSprayPaintMod/releases/latest)
- Place the `SuperSprayPaintMod` folder in:  
  `Drive Beyond Horizons\DriveBeyondHorizons\Binaries\Win64\ue4ss\Mods\`

### 3. Mod Configuration (Optional)
The mod comes pre-enabled with an `enabled.txt` file. No additional setup is required.

If you prefer to manage mods through configuration files, you can:
- Delete the `enabled.txt` file and add the mod to your configuration:
```
mods.txt:
SuperSprayPaintMod : 1

mods.json:
{
  "SuperSprayPaintMod": true
}
```


## Multiplayer

Note: This mod works best in single player.

- All players should have the mod installed
- Host-spawned cans have priority when applying paint
- Host can spawn cans of set colors for friends to use
- Friends of Host cannot change colors of host-spawned cans

## Known Issues

- Placing the spawned can into a hotbar slot overwrites the modded can. Just spawn a new one to get around this.
- The game saves normally, but if you try to exit via the in-game menu after spawning cans at least once, the game will crash. While it *is* annoying, it's relatively harmless.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the UE4SS console for error messages (requires zDEV-UE4SS install)
2. Make sure the mod is properly installed and enabled (either with enabled.txt or in mods.txt/mods.json)
3. If paint cans spawn in weird positions:
   - Make sure you're standing on relatively flat ground. Gas Stations and Repair Shops have the best flat ground.

## TODO

- ~~Add more colors~~ Completed
- ~~Increase paint amount per can~~ Completed
- ~~Add more useful tools~~ Completed
